# Modified pre-commit hook. Includes original pre-commit.sample script
# plus formatting.
#
# An example hook script to verify what is about to be committed.
# Called by "git commit" with no arguments.  The hook should
# exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate message if
# it wants to stop the commit.

### Format before committing, disabled for now ###

## Stage changes
#git commit --allow-empty --no-verify -m 'Save index'
#old_stash=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash)
#git stash push -m 'Unstaged changes'
#new_stash=$(git rev-parse -q --verify refs/stash)
#git reset --soft HEAD^
#
## Format unstaged
#./mvnw spotless:apply
#
## Add changes and pop stash
## If unstaged changes were stashed reapply to working tree
#git add -u
#if [ "$old_stash" != "$new_stash" ]; then
#    git stash pop
#fi

### Default pre-commit, disabled for now ###
